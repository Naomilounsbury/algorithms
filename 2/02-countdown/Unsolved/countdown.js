// Write code to print all numbers from `num` down to 1
// You may assume `num` will be a positive number

var countdown = function (num) {
    //for the variable i is placed at whatever num to start and then as long as i is greater than 0 then it will show the countdown of those numbers. Its a reverse for loop
  for (var i = num; i > 0; i--) {
    console.log(i);
  }
};
